1. SELECT T1.a1,T1.a2 FROM "A" AS T1 INNER JOIN "B" AS T2 ON T1.a1=T2.a1       //其实是拿2个完整的表去根据(T1.a1=T2.a1)交叉的结果中列出T1.a1,T1.a2,


2.和一个有SELECT的结果集进行交叉,然后列出T1.a1, T1.a2, T2.b1
SELECT T1.a1, T1.a2, T2.b1 FROM "A" AS T1
JOIN 
(
	SELECT a1, b1 FROM public."B" WHERE a1=1
)T2
ON (T1.a1 = T2.a1)



2边都带where条件的Join，第一个条件的where写在on的后面：

select 
        a.vopenid
            FROM
                ieg_tdbank::qmws_dsl_playerlogin_fht0 a

join
(
 select 
        vopenid
            FROM
                ieg_tdbank::qmws_dsl_playerlogin_fht0
			WHERE
			tdbank_imp_date >= '2016062200' and tdbank_imp_date < '2016062300'
 group by vopenid
)b
on (a.vopenid = b.vopenid)
WHERE
a.tdbank_imp_date >= '2016062300' and a.tdbank_imp_date < '2016062400'

3.主表带where带group by
select t.iuin from ieg_tdbank::tgclub_dsl_chargemsglog_fht0 t 
join
(
	select iuin from ieg_tdbank::tgclub_dsl_chargemsglog_fht0 group by iuin having max(chargestamp) < 1478508804
)t2
on(t.iuin = t2.iuin)
where t.tdbank_imp_date >= 2016103100 and t.tdbank_imp_date < 2016110800 and t.ioldpoint = t.inewpoint group by t.iuin


4.主表和从表都带where 和group by。并且交叉的字段是函数中得到的，此时。在主表字段在on中不可以使用别名
select '999001', parse_simple_json(a.kv,'cDeviceNet')[0] as net, parse_simple_json(a.kv,'url')[0] as url, parse_simple_json(a.kv,'cDeviceId')[0] as deviceid, avg(parse_simple_json(a.kv,'time')[0]) as time, count(1) as num from teg_mta_intf::ieg_xinyueclub a 
JOIN
(
	select '999000', parse_simple_json(kv,'cDeviceNet')[0] as net, parse_simple_json(kv,'url')[0] as url, parse_simple_json(kv,'cDeviceId')[0] as deviceid, avg(parse_simple_json(kv,'time')[0]) as time, count(1) as num from teg_mta_intf::ieg_xinyueclub where ei = '999000' group by parse_simple_json(kv,'cDeviceNet')[0],parse_simple_json(kv,'url')[0],parse_simple_json(kv,'cDeviceId')[0]
)b
on (
parse_simple_json(a.kv,'cDeviceId')[0] =
 b.deviceid)
where a.ei = '999001' group by parse_simple_json(a.kv,'cDeviceNet')[0],parse_simple_json(a.kv,'url')[0],parse_simple_json(a.kv,'cDeviceId')[0]


5.对于主表和从表都有group by。并且要提取从表的数据出来，是不可以的例如：下面提取了b的数据是无法编译。这种情况需要先做好聚合操作。插入到临时表中，再进行join
select a.col1,a.col2,b.col2 from xtable a group by col1,col2
join
(
	select col1,col2 from xtable b group by col1,col2
)
on (a.col1=b.col1)
group by a.col1 a.col2


Mysql 内连接:
select T1.toDeviceId,T2.DeviceId from draw_sensor as T1 right join draw_device as T2 ON T1.toDeviceId = T2.DeviceId and
T1.DrawingLogId in (select DrawingLogId from bts where iBtsId= 80)
	where T2.DrawingLogid in (select DrawingLogId from bts where iBtsId = 80 ) and T2.DeviceTypeId in (13,16,17,18)


右连接:
select T1.toDeviceId,T2.DeviceId from draw_sensor as T1 right join draw_device as T2 ON T1.toDeviceId = T2.DeviceId and
T1.DrawingLogId in (select DrawingLogId from bts where iBtsId= 80)
	where T2.DrawingLogid in (select DrawingLogId from bts where iBtsId = 80 ) and T2.DeviceTypeId in (13,16,17,18)


select (select count(toDeviceId) from (select T1.toDeviceId,T2.DeviceId from draw_sensor as T1 right join draw_device as T2 ON T1.toDeviceId = T2.DeviceId and
			T1.DrawingLogId in (select DrawingLogId from bts where iBtsId= 136)
			where T2.DrawingLogid in (select DrawingLogId from bts where iBtsId = 136 ) and T2.DeviceTypeId in (13,16,17,18) ) as A where toDeviceId is Not NULL)*100/
(
 select count(DeviceId) from (select T1.toDeviceId,T2.DeviceId from draw_sensor as T1 right join draw_device as T2 ON T1.toDeviceId = T2.DeviceId and
	 T1.DrawingLogId in (select DrawingLogId from bts where iBtsId= 136)
	 where T2.DrawingLogid in (select DrawingLogId from bts where iBtsId = 136 ) and T2.DeviceTypeId in (13,16,17,18) ) as A 
 ) as rate
